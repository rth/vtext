class HashingVectorizer(BaseEstimator):
    """Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token occurrences

    It turns a collection of text documents into a scipy.sparse matrix holding
    token occurrence counts (or binary occurrence information), possibly
    normalized as token frequencies if norm='l1' or projected on the euclidean
    unit sphere if norm='l2'.

    This text vectorizer implementation uses the hashing trick to find the
    token string name to feature integer index mapping.

    This strategy has several advantages:

    - it is very low memory scalable to large datasets as there is no need to
      store a vocabulary dictionary in memory

    - it is fast to pickle and un-pickle as it holds no state besides the
      constructor parameters

    - it can be used in a streaming (partial fit) or parallel pipeline as there
      is no state computed during fit.

    There are also a couple of cons (vs using a CountVectorizer with an
    in-memory vocabulary):

    - there is no way to compute the inverse transform (from feature indices to
      string feature names) which can be a problem when trying to introspect
      which features are most important to a model.

    - there can be collisions: distinct tokens can be mapped to the same
      feature index. However in practice this is rarely an issue if n_features
      is large enough (e.g. 2 ** 18 for text classification problems).

    - no IDF weighting as this would render the transformer stateful.

    The hash function employed is the signed 32-bit version of Murmurhash3.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <text_feature_extraction>`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    input : string {'filename', 'file', 'content'}
        If 'filename', the sequence passed as an argument to fit is
        expected to be a list of filenames that need reading to fetch
        the raw content to analyze.

        If 'file', the sequence items must have a 'read' method (file-like
        object) that is called to fetch the bytes in memory.

        Otherwise the input is expected to be the sequence strings or
        bytes items are expected to be analyzed directly.

    encoding : string, default='utf-8'
        If bytes or files are given to analyze, this encoding is used to
        decode.

    decode_error : {'strict', 'ignore', 'replace'}
        Instruction on what to do if a byte sequence is given to analyze that
        contains characters not of the given `encoding`. By default, it is
        'strict', meaning that a UnicodeDecodeError will be raised. Other
        values are 'ignore' and 'replace'.

    strip_accents : {'ascii', 'unicode', None}
        Remove accents and perform other character normalization
        during the preprocessing step.
        'ascii' is a fast method that only works on characters that have
        an direct ASCII mapping.
        'unicode' is a slightly slower method that works on any characters.
        None (default) does nothing.

        Both 'ascii' and 'unicode' use NFKD normalization from
        :func:`unicodedata.normalize`.

    lowercase : boolean, default=True
        Convert all characters to lowercase before tokenizing.

    preprocessor : callable or None (default)
        Override the preprocessing (string transformation) stage while
        preserving the tokenizing and n-grams generation steps.

    tokenizer : callable or None (default)
        Override the string tokenization step while preserving the
        preprocessing and n-grams generation steps.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.

    stop_words : string {'english'}, list, or None (default)
        If 'english', a built-in stop word list for English is used.
        There are several known issues with 'english' and you should
        consider an alternative (see :ref:`stop_words`).

        If a list, that list is assumed to contain stop words, all of which
        will be removed from the resulting tokens.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.

    token_pattern : string
        Regular expression denoting what constitutes a "token", only used
        if ``analyzer == 'word'``. The default regexp selects tokens of 2
        or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored
        and always treated as a token separator).

    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n), default=(1, 1)
        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different
        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n
        will be used.

    analyzer : string, {'word', 'char', 'char_wb'} or callable
        Whether the feature should be made of word or character n-grams.
        Option 'char_wb' creates character n-grams only from text inside
        word boundaries; n-grams at the edges of words are padded with space.

        If a callable is passed it is used to extract the sequence of features
        out of the raw, unprocessed input.

    n_features : integer, default=(2 ** 20)
        The number of features (columns) in the output matrices. Small numbers
        of features are likely to cause hash collisions, but large numbers
        will cause larger coefficient dimensions in linear learners.

    binary : boolean, default=False.
        If True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete
        probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer
        counts.

    norm : 'l1', 'l2' or None, optional
        Norm used to normalize term vectors. None for no normalization.

    alternate_sign : boolean, optional, default True
        When True, an alternating sign is added to the features as to
        approximately conserve the inner product in the hashed space even for
        small n_features. This approach is similar to sparse random projection.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    dtype : type, optional
        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().

    If you do not provide an a-priori dictionary and you do not use an analyzer

    token_pattern : string
        Regular expression denoting what constitutes a "token", only used
        if ``analyzer == 'word'``. The default regexp select tokens of 2
        or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored

    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n)
        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different

        out of the raw, unprocessed input.

    max_df : float in range [0.0, 1.0] or int, default=1.0
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly higher than the given threshold (corpus-specific
        stop words).
        If float, the parameter represents a proportion of documents, integer
        absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    min_df : float in range [0.0, 1.0] or int, default=1
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly lower than the given threshold. This value is also
        called cut-off in the literature.
        If float, the parameter represents a proportion of documents, integer
        absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    max_features : int or None, default=None
        If not None, build a vocabulary that only consider the top
        max_features ordered by term frequency across the corpus.

        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    vocabulary : Mapping or iterable, optional
        Either a Mapping (e.g., a dict) where keys are terms and values are
        indices in the feature matrix, or an iterable over terms. If not
        given, a vocabulary is determined from the input documents. Indices
        in the mapping should not be repeated and should not have any gap
        between 0 and the largest index.

    binary : boolean, default=False
        If True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete
        probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer
        counts.

    dtype : type, optional
        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().

    Attributes
    ----------
    vocabulary_ : dict
        A mapping of terms to feature indices.

    stop_words_ : set
        Terms that were ignored because they either:

          - occurred in too many documents (`max_df`)
          - occurred in too few documents (`min_df`)
          - were cut off by feature selection (`max_features`).

        This is only available if no vocabulary was given.
